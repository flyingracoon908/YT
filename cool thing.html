          <br /><br />
          TGB is a youtube streamer which focus around gaming.<br />
          <br />
          We at TGB aims to provide a service for all kinds of gamers across the
          world, may it be casual or competitive gaming.<br />
          <br />
          We aim to provide entertaining gaming content for all to enjoy and to
          learn from. Providing walkthroughs to those gamers who doesnt want to
          stuggle with complicated puzzles<br />
          or for those gamers that doesn't want to leave any rock unturned to
          find every easter egg available, we provide full walkthroughs for that
          purpose.<br />
          <br />
          We also show gameplay to gamers that are not sure if they should
          invest in a particular game that they would or would not enjoy. Allow
          us to help you decide!<br />
          If you like what you see, you welcome to give it a shot, of not, we
          did our job making sure you enjoy the game you decide to give your
          100% to.<br />
          <br />
          The reason behind our hard work and content is because, we too have
          sat for 3 days straight without any progress in a game!<br />
          We too, took 24hrs to defeat an enemy that is not the final boss and
          if it is the final boss, we cannot complete the storyline of that game
          because we are unable to meet the minimal requiremenet, and how
          frustraring it is to go through that<br />
          <br />
          We want to walk along side all our views and guide them to the best
          gaming experience out there and not feel as if they have nowhere to
          turn to.<br />
          gaming is not just a hobby, its a lifestyle, and as a person who loves
          gaming, I dedicate myself to showing others why i love gaming.<br />
          Its not just about pressing buttons blindly but its used as a
          universal language to communicate and understand people better. To
          find that you as a gamer are not going through things alone and there
          are a whole community along side you has a comforting feeling to
          it.<br />
          <br />
          That is what TGB stands for, that is what we are about> We all are
          TGB, as a community, as a people, come together and do what we
          love.<br />
